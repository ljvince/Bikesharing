#### on the two images below , we will notice that the most user are start and end at the south of manhattan.
#### in the center park area which is south of manhattan is quite slow but still more than out side of manhattan.
#### therefore we will focus the user they are working at downtown first and the user they are relax at the mainly park second. and user out side of the downtown should lower down our number of bike.

## Summary:
#### Overall, bikeshare services are highly poplular in the busy metropolitan areas, where bristle the occupied real estate and sort of the parking space and also bad traffic. The user base is made up mostly of male subscribers,sort distance and go to office on weekday, they are the provider of regular income to the program. 

#### Two additional lines of inquiry for analysis and visulazation.
  ##### First, by birth year, average trip duration, to explore if there is an difference riders as they age.
  ##### Second, add more data by bike type to explore if there are more outreach should be done to attract female rider marketing.

#### however,even there is more possibility to reach out different marketing, like tourist or children data, or just more research for user who haven't subscrib and ETC. the male users seem a reliable market. And main usage seems focused around morning and evening commute times.
